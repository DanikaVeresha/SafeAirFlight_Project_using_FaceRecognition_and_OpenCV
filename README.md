This project describes the implementation of safe air travel taking into account real-time weather conditions, as well as prohibited flight zones (conditionally accepted), 
and monitoring the general situation using online video monitoring in the aircraft cabin and in the pilotâ€™s cockpit. This project was created in order to make air travel as 
safe as possible, to eliminate as much as possible the human factor (the pilot making an erroneous decision along the route).
